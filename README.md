## **Data validator is a library that can be used to check the correctness of any data.**
_The presented code describes the operation of a data validator, whose task is to check the correctness of the user's entered data._
_The result of the check is displayed in Boolean format, where "true" indicates that the entered data is correct, "false" indicates the opposite._
_**First of all, we are talking about data from forms filled out by users.**_


_To work with the application, the user must enter the following data into the console using the Jshell utility:_

⋅⋅ 1) First of all, a data validator is created

⋅⋅ 2) Next, depending on the type of data that needs to be checked, you need to create an appropriate data validator: using the "string" method - a validator is created to check string values, using the "number" method - a validator is created to check the correctness of integer values, using the "map" method " a validator is created to check the correctness of objects of the Map type

⋅⋅ 3) After creating a specific type of validator, you need to fill it with the appropriate rules that determine the correctness of the entered data

⋅⋅ 4) And finally we call the isValid() method, in the parameters of which we enter data to check it with our previously created validator
